# My-version-control-system

# This was an academic project I completed in Fall 2019 for Computer Science 61B at University of California Berkeley.
# Each file was created from scratch with absolutely no template. The function of the project is to employ a simple version
# control system very similar to the function of Github. However, the version control system utilizes a local repository.
# The structure of system is such that any commands to the terminal will be interpreted by my Main.class. My Commands.class
# execute the necessary procedures. My Commit.class is utilized to store the most recent version of whatever file is being
# saved. The other files are either unit tests for my commands.class or integration tests used to confirm the success of the
# project.
